### ENTRY: 2025-01-11 23:42:01 UTC
TYPE: Initial Documentation
STATUS: In Progress

CURRENT ISSUE ADDRESSED:
- Solar Detach & Reset section behavior mismatch with Solar section

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
1. Changed HTML in solar-detach-reset-section:
   - FROM: onclick="submitForm().then(() => showSection('review-section'))"
   - TO: onclick="nextFromSolarDetachReset()"

2. Added new function:
```javascript
function nextFromSolarDetachReset() {
    showSection('review-section');
    submitForm()
        .then(async () => {
            await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000));
            const pdfId = await getLatestPdfId();
            if (pdfId) {
                displayPDF(pdfId);
            } else {
                throw new Error('No PDF ID found');
            }
        })
        .catch(error => {
            console.error('Error:', error);
            showError();
        })
        .finally(() => {
            hideLoading();
        });
}
### ENTRY: 2025-01-12 00:01:07 UTC
TYPE: Code Correction
STATUS: Implemented
AUTHOR: Khaas01

ISSUE ADDRESSED:
- Form submission data structure mismatch between frontend and Google Apps Script
- Only Timestamp and User Login were being recorded in Form Responses sheet

ROOT CAUSE:
1. Data structure inconsistency between collectFormData() and submitForm()
2. Field names not matching exactly with Google Sheet headers
3. Missing explicit data wrapper structure required by Apps Script

IMPLEMENTATION CHANGES:

1. Standardized collectFormData():
   - Changed all field names to match Google Sheet headers exactly
   - Added missing fields identified in header comparison
   - Structured data with exact header names:
   ```javascript
   const formData = {
       "Timestamp": new Date().toISOString(),
       "User Login": "Khaas01",
       "Sales Rep Name": document.getElementById('salesRepName')?.value || '',
       // ... all other fields matching headers exactly
   };
Restructured submitForm():
Created explicit data mapping for every field
Implemented complete header-matching structure:
JavaScript
const submissionData = {
    data: {
        "Timestamp": formData["Timestamp"],
        "User Login": formData["User Login"],
        // ... exact mapping for all fields
    }
};
AFFECTED FILES:

script.js
Modified collectFormData() function
Modified submitForm() function
TESTING PERFORMED:

Verified field name matching with Google Sheet headers
Confirmed data structure matches Apps Script expectations
Validated form submission format
DEPENDENCIES AFFECTED:

Google Apps Script integration
Form submission process
PDF generation workflow
ERROR MESSAGES RESOLVED:

JavaScript
// Previous error in Apps Script logs
"No data received in request"
"Failed to parse form data"
VERIFICATION STEPS:

Form submission should now include all fields
Data structure should match:
JavaScript
{
    data: {
        "Header Exact Name": "value",
        // ... all other fields
    }
}
NEXT STEPS:

Monitor form submissions for complete data transfer
Verify PDF generation with complete data
Test all form paths to ensure data collection
Add validation for required fields

### ENTRY: 2025-01-12 00:13:45 UTC
TYPE: Code Correction
STATUS: Fixed
AUTHOR: Khaas01

ISSUE:
Inconsistent element ID naming in showError function

CORRECTION:
- Reverted variable name back to 'estimatePreviewFrame' from 'previewFrame'
- Maintains consistency with existing codebase naming conventions
- Matches the HTML element ID used throughout the application

AFFECTED CODE:
```javascript
// Changed from:
const previewFrame = document.getElementById('estimatePreviewFrame');

// Back to:
const estimatePreviewFrame = document.getElementById('estimatePreviewFrame');
REASON FOR CONSISTENCY:

'estimatePreviewFrame' is used throughout the codebase
Maintains clear connection to the HTML element ID
Prevents potential confusion in code maintenance
Follows established naming patterns in the project

### ENTRY: 2025-01-12 00:24:07 UTC
TYPE: Process Flow Correction
STATUS: Implemented
AUTHOR: Khaas01

ISSUE:
PDF loading sequence was incorrect, attempting to load PDF on initial page load instead of waiting for form submission and Apps Script processing.

ROOT CAUSE:
- Incorrect initialization in DOMContentLoaded event
- PDF loading logic not properly synchronized with form submission flow
- Premature PDF ID fetching

CHANGES IMPLEMENTED:
1. Removed PDF loading from initial page load
2. Modified showSection function to handle review section properly
3. Adjusted submitForm sequence to:
   - Submit form data
   - Wait for Apps Script processing
   - Fetch PDF ID with retries
   - Display PDF only after confirmation

PROCESS FLOW (Updated):
1. Initial load → Sales Rep Section only
2. Form Submission → Loading animation
3. Apps Script Processing → 2s initial delay
4. PDF ID Fetch → Up to 3 retries with 3s delays
5. PDF Display → Only after successful ID fetch

VERIFICATION:
- Tested form submission flow
- Confirmed loading states display properly
- Verified PDF only loads after form processing
- Validated error handling scenarios

NEXT STEPS:
1. Monitor form submissions for proper timing
2. Collect feedback on loading animation duration
3. Track any PDF generation failures

STATUS: Fixed
AUTHOR: Khaas01

ISSUE:
Global scope console.log attempting to access undefined formData variable
Location: script.js:404

PROBLEM:
Debugging statement incorrectly placed in global scope:
`console.log('Form Data Being Sent:', JSON.stringify(formData, null, 2));`

FIX:
1. Removed stray console.log statement from global scope
2. If debugging is needed, logging should be moved inside submitForm function

VERIFICATION:
- ReferenceError should no longer occur on page load
- Form submission debugging can be done within proper function scope

NOTE:
For future debugging of form data, place console.log inside submitForm:
- After formData is created
- Before fetch call
- Within proper error handling

COMPONENT: PDF Display System

ISSUE:
Conflict between srcdoc and src attributes in iframe causing PDF display failure
- Loading animation overriding PDF source
- Multiple places setting srcdoc attribute
- Loading state persisting after PDF load attempt

ANALYSIS:
Root cause identified as competing iframe content settings:
1. showLoading() - Setting srcdoc with loading animation
2. showError() - Setting srcdoc with error message
3. displayPDF() - Attempting to set src attribute for PDF

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
1. Removed all srcdoc usage from iframe
2. Created external loading/error UI elements:
   - Added pdf-loading-indicator div
   - Added pdf-error-message div
3. Modified display sequence:
   - Clear iframe with about:blank
   - Show loading indicator outside iframe
   - Set security attributes
   - Set PDF src
   - Handle load/error events
4. Improved error handling and logging

CODE CHANGES:
- Refactored showLoading()
- Refactored showError()
- Updated displayPDF()
- Added proper cleanup methods

VERIFICATION:
Required testing:
1. PDF loading sequence
2. Error handling
3. Loading indicator visibility
4. Multiple form submissions
5. Navigation between sections

NEXT STEPS:
1. Monitor PDF display success rate
2. Collect any error reports
3. Verify loading indicator behavior
